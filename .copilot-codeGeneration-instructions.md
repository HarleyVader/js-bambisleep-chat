# BambiSleep Chat Code Generation Guidelines

## Overall Style

- Write minimalist, straightforward code that prioritizes simplicity over edge cases
- Functions should do one thing and be as short as possible
- Favor direct solutions over "best practices" when they add complexity
- Use existing patterns found in the codebase rather than introducing new ones

## Formatting and Documentation

- Use brief, single-line comments explaining logic rather than extensive documentation
- Keep code lines short and readable
- Only document complex logic that isn't immediately obvious
- No JSDoc style comments unless absolutely necessary

## Functionality

- Provide the simplest implementation that solves the immediate problem
- Don't add error handling for unlikely edge cases
- Assume happy path execution in most cases
- Reuse existing utility functions rather than creating new ones

## Specific Patterns

- Use plain JavaScript over complex abstractions or frameworks
- Follow the existing CSS naming conventions and color variables
- Use direct DOM manipulation instead of complex frameworks
- Prefer simple event listeners and callbacks

## Variables and Functions

- Use meaningful but concise variable and function names
- Keep function parameter counts low (1-3 parameters when possible)
- Avoid complex destructuring unless it significantly simplifies code
- Prefer named functions over anonymous arrow functions for main functionality

## Avoid

- Creating new files always update the existing code
- Over-engineering solutions
- Extensive error handling for unlikely scenarios
- Complex abstractions that hide simple operations
- Adding dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Deep nesting of functions or callbacks

## State Management

- Use centralized state management for related features
- Keep state objects simple and flat when possible
- Use events to communicate state changes between components
- Store state in localStorage for persistence where appropriate
- Follow existing patterns for state updates and notifications
