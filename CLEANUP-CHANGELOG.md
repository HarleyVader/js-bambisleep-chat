# BambiSleep Chat Codebase Cleanup Changelog

## 2025-05-18: Initial Codebase Cleanup

### Removed Files
- `src/config/dbConnection.js` - Redundant database connection implementation
- `src/utils/doxxerinator.js` - Removed due to privacy concerns and lack of usage
- `src/utils/memory-management.js` - Client-side code inappropriately placed in server-side directory

### Created Files  
- `src/public/js/system-controls.js` - Added wrapper to maintain compatibility with views that reference a non-existent file

### Modified Files
- `src/utils/connectionMonitor.js` - Added documentation to clarify relationship with db.js

### File Relocations
- Moved `folder-structure.md` to docs folder
- Moved `README-imageGenerator.md` to docs folder
- Relocated test file `imageGeneratorTest.js` to proper test directory

### Backup Strategy
- Created backup directory with copies of all removed files (.bak extension)
- All changes are documented in this changelog

## Rationale
The cleanup was performed to:
1. Remove redundant database connection implementations
2. Properly separate client-side and server-side code
3. Eliminate potential privacy concerns in unused code
4. Improve file organization
5. Ensure backward compatibility during transition

No functionality was removed in this cleanup process; only duplicate or unused code was affected.
